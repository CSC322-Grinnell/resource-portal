Dear Zoe and Zhi,


If you want to get access to all of the categories (the names of the resource categories),
you can get it through @categories that exists in the controller.


In the view submission form, the user clicks "Complete" and a bundle of information
is sent to the form_controller. This bundle should be a hash table consisting of all of the 
information agreed upon for the form. The form_controller will then store the information retreived
from the hash into the resource model.
